				<p>
					EVEMail is system that is designed to make it easy for you to stay in touch with members of a community that so many of us have come to love and enjoy.  It allows you to seamlessly login and check your mail and easily reply to that mail knowing full well that that response will be delivered to that recipient.

                <h3 class="page-header">Why EVEMails</h3>
				<p>
					EVEMail was chosen because the developer knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he could create a reliable system that people would enjoy using and find comfort in, knowing that the Mail that was being transmitted via his system was secure, was unsaleable, and uncompromising.
